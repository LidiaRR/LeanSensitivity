## Description

This code is part of my Bachelor's thesis and consists of a set of results involving the Sensitivity Conjecture. To execute it, follow the instructions to install Lean found at [Lean Installation](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

## Contents

- `Basics.lean` contains basic definitions of the hypercube that are used throughout all the rest of files

- `IndependentSet.lean` contains the definitions related to the independence number, gives the first extremal example and a proof that it is such extremal example

- `InclusionExclusion.lean` gives a proof of the inclusion-exclusion principle

- `NeatPartition.lean` contains the definition of neat partition and a proof of the existance of such partition for any n > 0

- `ParityFamilies.lean` defines the second extremal example and some auxiliar lemmas about its structure

- `ExactnessExample.lean` gives a proof that the second example is the extremal example we need
